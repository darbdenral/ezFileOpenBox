# ezFileOpenBox
 The ezFileOpenBox VisualNeo-Win-Plugin-Distribution

This plugin is a replacement for the VisualNeo command FileOpenBox

With this plugin you can obtain a filename or filename(s) using a Windows file open dialog box and optionally ensure that the opening directory is restored when the dialog box is closed.  This plugin is programmed with C# with .NET framework 4.5.  The file dialog has a much better preview than the default VisualNeo FileOpenBox, great for images and such.
